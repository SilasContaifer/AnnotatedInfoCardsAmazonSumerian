The Amazon Sumerian official video tutorial showing how to add info cards* present to the users with one big script where you could copy the code to create three JavaScripts to use, but the file has some mistakes that I corrected.

The originial link is: https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&v=HoKdYh_nPTw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fsumerian-docs-assets.s3.amazonaws.com%2FIntroCourse_InfoCards.js&redir_token=aaKUhZW_rqq5GdJ_nBG-UWKXaxp8MTU4ODcyMjc2OUAxNTg4NjM2MzY5

I will not only upload my correct version IntroCourse_InfoCards.js as I will let the same code separate as it could help for future implementations here in GitHub.
